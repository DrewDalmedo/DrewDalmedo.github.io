Back in 2005, when I was only a little kid, I was first introduced to the world of computing. This introduction was through one of the most innocent ways imaginable: a small little box, one which seems tiny now, but back then was huge in my eyes. This small little box, this cube, was the Nintendo Gamecube, and man, I loved that thing. 

It was a gateway to limitless possibilities. One which made the bulky, 5 ton Sony TV our family had come to life, one which transported me into all sorts of different worlds, one which held limitless potential and wonder. From kart racing tracks to snowy mountain peaks and street racing, this small cube could take me anywhere. 

That sense of wonder and awe made me start asking many questions. How did this magical box work? What was beneath the shell? How did an entire world, which was stored on a super tiny disk, go from something I put into the disk drive to something displayed on my TV? Better yet, how were these worlds created? I soon got my answer: all of this was possible because a team of talented people set out to create something amazing. The artists created the artwork, 3D models, sprites, and more. The game designers made sure that the game was actually fun to play. But, the people who glued everything together and made the game really come to life were the software engineers. They seemed to be the masters of their digital universes, able to create anything they wished, able to do anything they wished. That was what made software engineering seem almost magical.

Since then, I had always wanted to become a software engineer. That sense of wonder I had back then still drives me to create things today, and is something unique I bring to all of my projects. The coming months here at Flatiron may be tough, but I’m more than willing to take on the challenge, and (hopefully) have some fun while doing it!

Here’s to an amazing Flatiron experience, and an even brighter future.
